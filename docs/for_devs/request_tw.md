# Requesting a Technical Writer

While technical writers are always up for a quick chat, they need to plan ahead for substantial contributions. You might need to document a new feature, explain some technical concept in a new article, or amend an old article.

## Plan Ahead

The technical writing team takes up to two weeks to produce the requested text. This time includes research, reworking your draft or writing an article from scratch, and editing the final commission, all while processing multiple other requests. In exceptional circumstances technical writers can provide you with a commission to a 24h deadline. Keep in mind that this puts strain on technical writers and puts all other requests on hold. Plan ahead, contact writers early, and respond swiftly. This is the smoothest way to get your project well documented.

## Do Your Homework

Make sure that you did your [homework](./developer_guide.md) before making a request. Decide what a writer has to do for you. Think about how could you help. 
As always, feel free to reach out to a writer if you need advise.

## Prepare Your Pull Request

Either use your feature branch or create a new branch with the `docs/` prefix. Commit all necessary information: drafts, prompts, weblinks. You could do it directly in the file to change, or inside the `documentation/docs/in_progress` directory.

## Contact Writers

Tag the `@iotaledger/tech-writers` team in your PR. Tell what to do in the pull request description or in the comments.

## Review the Commission

As you know your project better, technical writers will turn to your expertise through the whole process. Once they are done, however, you are the final judge of the work. Read it carefully, make sure that it provides all necessary information, provides only true information, has no ambiguous meanings, and does not misrepresent your work in any other way.

Technical writers will notify you when their commission is ready for a review.

## Merge

Once you and the technical writers approve the commission, merge it. Technical writers have no writing access to your repository.

If you wish, you can squash your branch to remove intermediate drafts from the git history.
