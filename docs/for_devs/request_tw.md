# Requesting a Technical Writer

While technical writers are always up for a quick chat, they need to plan ahead for substantial contributions. You might need to document a new feature, amend an article, or write a new one.

## Plan Ahead

The technical writing team takes up to two weeks to produce the requested text. In that time, writers research the topic, rework your draft or write an article from scratch, review and edit their commission, all while processing multiple other requests. In exceptional circumstances technical writers could work against a twenty-four hours deadline, but keep in mind that this would put all other requests on hold and strain technical writers. Plan ahead, contact writers early, and respond swiftly. This is the smoothest way to get your project well documented.

## Do Your Homework

Make sure that you did your [homework](./developer_guide.md) before making a request. Decide what a writer has to do for you. Think about how could you help. 
As always, feel free to reach out to a writer if you need advise.

## Prepare Your Pull Request

Either use your feature branch or create a new branch with the `docs/` prefix. Commit all necessary information: drafts, prompts, weblinks. You could do it directly in the file to change, or inside the `documentation/docs/in_progress` directory.

## Contact Writers

Tag the `@iotaledger/tech-writers` team in your PR. Tell what to do in the pull request description or in the comments.

## Review the Commission

Technical writers will turn to your expertise through the whole process. Even more, you are the final judge of their work. Read it carefully, make sure that it provides all necessary information, provides only true information, has no ambiguous meanings, and presents your project in its spirit.

Technical writers will notify you when their commission is ready for a review.

## Merge

Once you and the technical writers approve the commission, merge it. Technical writers have no writing access to your repository.

If you wish, you can squash your branch to remove intermediate drafts from the git history.
