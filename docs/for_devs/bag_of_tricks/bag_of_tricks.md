# Bag of Tricks

Technical writers ask for quite a lot from you. Not only you have to provide us with information, but you also have to structure it well and make sure that it is precise and extensive.

Sometimes you just stare at a blank page not knowing where to begin. Sometimes you do not know where to end. We offer you a bag of tricks to get you going, a collection of tools that help you to put your expertise into written words.

You could give all tools a try from the very beginning. Or you could try only the tools you liked. Or you could read the whole list and look for an opportunity to test them later. You could even close this page until you would need advice. Or you could invent your own way to document your work and never get back. Tools are never mandatory. To quote Roy Peter Clark, an American journalist and teacher:

> Remember, these are tools, not rules. They work outside the territory of right and wrong, and inside the land of cause and effect.

You pick a tool because you have a reason to, and every tool is best used to produce only certain results.
