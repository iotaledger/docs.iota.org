# Documentation for Developers

Documentation rarely attracts developers enough to read it, let alone write it. Writing documentation is hard, and it is even harder to write captivating one. Luckily, IOTA has a team of dedicated technical writers.

This document explains how you can help technical writers, and how they can help you in return. It will evolve as we invent more ways to help each other. Check it for updates once in a while.

You are the author of your code. It makes you the original source of knowledge, the most reliable and often the only one. Technical writers cannot replace you or let you forget about the documentation boogieman. Quite the opposite, we want you to always keep documentation in mind as you work so we could support you and make sure that users and other developers enjoy learning about your work.

## Make a Friend

If you have not got in contact with a technical writer yet, do it! We can give you an advice, ask the right questions and plan together. The earlier you get in touch, the easier it will be. Reach out to us through Slack DMs, `#dev-documentation` Slack channel, or via e-mail. If you come from outside IOTA, check the [Team](https://docs.iota.org/team) page for the external contacts.

Active technical writers:

- Aleksei Korolev
- Charles Thompson
- Lukas Tortora
- Sebastian Heusser

## Do Your Homework

For every technical writer IOTA has ten or so software engineers. For four technical writers, there is a dozen and a half of projects and products. On your average week, only one technical writer can attend to your project, and only for a day or two. The major bulk of the work is on your shoulders.

The most consuming part of writing is not writing itself but the research of the subject. You have to gather bits of knowledge, structure it, decide what is worth mentioning and what not. Then you put it into words, draft up an article, rewrite it clean, let others review it and publish your work. The more you can do on your own, the faster your project will be documented.

Some tasks you can manage on your own. For some you would need advice. Some tasks are better left to a technical writer. Contact the writers' team and distribute the effort early.

To help you help us, we have prepared a [bag of tricks](./bag_of_tricks/bag_of_tricks.md), a collection of tools, tricks, techniques and tips.

## Do Your Work

An API reference already has a structure. Each function gets its own entry. Every entry has a few fields. Every field needs only a sentence or two. There is too little room for writers to matter. Yet you need to understand the code well: you can make API reference better than any technical writer could.

Feel free to ask technical writers for an advice or a review. 

## Make It Official

A direct talk is great to get a quick answer or advice, but there are more projects than there are technical writers, and we need to plan ahead for any substantial contribution. See [Requesting a Technical Writer](./request_tw.md) for details.
