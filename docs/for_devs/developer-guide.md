# Documentation for Developers

Writing documentation for your program is a boring, excruciating, thankless job. Luckily, you have someone who just enjoys that: the team of technical writers. This document explains how do we work from now on, what technical writers expect from you, and how they can help you in return. Naturally, these processes will always be in change, and no revision of this document will ever be final.

As a software engineer, you know your project the best, making you the most reliable and often the only one source of knowledge for technical writers. Our goal is not to replace you and let you forget about documentation, but quite the opposite: we want you to always keep documentation in mind as you work. In return, we will support you and make sure that users and other developers enjoy learning about your work.

## Make a Friend

If you have not got in contact with a technical writer yet, do it! We can help you, give you an advice, ask the right questions and plan together. The earlier technical writers are involved, the easier it will be for us to produce documentation together. Reach out to us through Slack DMs, `#dev-documentation` Slack channel, or via e-mail.

Active technical writers:

- Aleksei Korolev
- Charles Thompson
- Lukas Tortora
- Sebastian Heusser

## Do Your Homework

For every technical writer IOTA has ten or so software engineers. For four technical writers, there is a dozen and a half of projects and products. It means that on an average week only one technical writer would attend to your team and would do that for just a day or two. The major bulk of the work is on your shoulders.

The most consuming part of writing is not writing itself but the research of the subject. You have to gather and collect bits of information, structure it, decide what is worth your reader's attention and what not. Then you put it into words, draft up an article, rewrite it clean, let others review it and finally publish your work. The more you can do on your own, the faster your project will be documented.

Some tasks you can manage on your own. For some you would need advice. Some tasks are better left to a technical writer. Contact the writers' team early and plan your work first.

To help you help us, we have prepared a [bag of tricks](./bag_of_tricks/bag_of_tricks.md), a collection of tools, tricks, techniques and tips.

## Do Your Work

Technical writers can write a welcoming page or a README of your project, prepare project overview, instructions to set it up, user guides, manuals, and tutorials. However, you are better suited to write API reference than we are. It requires deep understanding of underlying code, but it is also arguably easier to write: it is heavily structured in little blocks of one or two sentences. Keep in mind the same questions as in the previous section and you will come up with a solid API reference. Technical writers are still there to help you write, review your work, and maybe point out if you overlooked something.

## Make It Official

A direct talk is a great way to get a quick answer or advice, but there are more projects than there are technical writers, and we need to plan ahead. See [Requesting a Technical Writer](./request-tw.md) for details.
