# Documentation for Developers

Writing documentation for your program is a boring, excruciating, thankless job. Luckily, you have someone who just enjoys that: the team of technical writers. This document explains how do we work from now on, what technical writers expect from you, and how they can help you in return. Naturally, these processes will always be in change, and no revision of this document will ever be final.

As a software engineer, you know your project the best, making you the most reliable and often the only one source of knowledge for technical writers. Our goal is not to replace you and let you forget about documentation, but quite the opposite: we want you to always keep documentation in mind as you work. In return, we will support you and make sure that users and other developers enjoy learning about your work.

## Make a Friend

If you have not got in contact with a technical writer yet, do it! We can help you, give you an advice, ask the right questions and plan together. The earlier technical writers are involved, the easier it will be for us to produce documentation together. Reach out to us through Slack DMs, `#dev-documentation` Slack channel, or via e-mail.

Active technical writers:

- Aleksei Korolev
- Charles Thompson
- Lukas Tortora
- Sebastian Heusser

## Do Your Homework

No matter if we write an overview of a product or an example for a specific usage of a feature, we will always ask you the same questions:

1. Who will use it?
2. Why they use it? What problems they solve?
3. What do they need to use it? Do they need to know something?
4. How do they use it?
5. What do they get as a result? What can they do with it?
6. All the same but with negations: when they should not use it? How to misuse it? If something goes wrong, how do they know? How do they cope with that?

These are useful questions. They help us, and they can help you: you will implement a better feature if you know what it is for. Find the answers beforehand and this will likely pay off.

It is up to you how do you want to give us the answers. We can have a chat or a talk. You can draft up an article yourself. You can write down a bunch of use cases or user stories: Ivan Jacobson and Rachel Davies have invented these tools to help engineering teams find the answers and keep track of them. 

## Do Your Work

Technical writers can write a welcoming page or a README of your project, prepare project overview, instructions to set it up, user guides, manuals, and tutorials. However, you are better suited to write API reference than we are. It requires deep understanding of underlying code, but it is also arguably easier to write: it is heavily structured in little blocks of one or two sentences. Keep in mind the same questions as in the previous section and you will come up with a solid API reference. Technical writers are still there to help you write, review your work, and maybe point out if you overlooked something.

## Make It Official

A direct talk is a great way to get a quick answer or advice, but there are more projects than there are technical writers, and we need to plan ahead. See [Requesting a Technical Writer](./request-tw.md) for details.
