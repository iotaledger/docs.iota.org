# Requesting a Technical Writer

While technical writers are always up for a chat or a talk to advise or consult you, more substantial requests need a more formal approach. This page mainly covers the process of requesting documentation for a new feature, but can also be applied when you need a new technical article, or when you amend an existing one.

Make sure that you did your [homework](./developer-guide.md) before making a formal request. As always, feel free to reach out to technical writers if you need advise.

## Plan Ahead

The technical writing team takes up to two weeks to produce the requested text. This time includes research, reworking your draft or writing an article from scratch, and editing the final commission, all while processing multiple other requests. In exceptional circumstances technical writers can provide you with a commission to a 24h deadline. Keep in mind that this puts strain on technical writers and puts all other requests on hold, damaging IOTA Foundation as a whole. Plan ahead, contact writers early, and respond swiftly. This is the most smooth way to get your project well documented.

## Contact Writers

Tag the `@iotaledger/tech-writers` team in your PR.

## Review the Commission

As you know your project better, technical writers will turn to your expertise through the whole process. Once they are done, however, you are the final judge of the work. Read it carefully, make sure that it provides all necessary information, that it provides only true information, that is has no ambiguous meanings, and does not misrepresent your work in any other way.

Technical writers will notify you when their commission is ready for a review.

## Merge

Once you and the technical writers approve the commission, merge it. Technical writers have no writing access to your repository.
